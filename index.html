        <p>Come stay with us in New Orleans! We live in a traditional New Orleans shotgun duplex just a 15 minute walk from Frenchmen Street (full of Jazz venues such as The Spotted Cat) and 20 minute walk from the French Quarter. There’s also lots of bars, restaurants, and cafes nearby.</p>

        <p>You’ll be staying on a fold-out sofa. The layout is traditional shotgun style, meaning you have to either walk through our bedroom to access the bathroom or kitchen – or walk around outside.</p>

        <p>We don’t ask that you pay us anything to stay in our home. However, we’d be thrilled if you made a donation to St. Roch Comunity Garden. Our back yard leads into the garden, which provides healthy food and education to the neighbhorhood. So far we’ve raised $312 for the garden!</p>
